      <h3>MONKEYS</h3>

      <p>The dusky leaf monkey, also known as the spectacled langur or spectacled leaf monkey (<i>Trachypithecus obscurus</i>), is a species of primate in the family Cercopithecidae. It is found in Malaysia, Burma, and Thailand.</p>

      <p>These monkeys are known for the white circles around their eyes, giving them a "spectacled" appearance. They are mostly folivorous, eating a diet rich in leaves and fruits, and are known for their gentle and social nature.</p>

      <p>Dusky leaf monkeys usually live in small groups and spend most of their time in trees. They are an important species in their ecosystems for seed dispersal and forest regeneration.</p>

      <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</p></strong>
      <p>You will find the monkeys at the monkey cage near the Monkey Trail.</p>
