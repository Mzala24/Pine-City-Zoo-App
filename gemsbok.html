      <h3>GEMSBOKS</h3>

      <p>The gemsbok or gemsbuck (<i>Oryx gazella</i>) is a large antelope native to the arid regions of Southern Africa, including the Kalahari Desert. It belongs to the genus <i>Oryx</i> and is known for its striking appearance and impressive horns.</p>

      <p>The gemsbok is depicted on the coat of arms of Namibia, where the current population of the species is estimated at around 373,000 individuals. Although similar in appearance to the chamois of Europe, they are not closely related.</p>

      <p>Both male and female gemsboks have long, straight horns, and their facial patterns and body markings make them one of the most visually distinctive antelope species. They are well adapted to dry environments and can go without drinking water for long periods, extracting moisture from the food they eat.</p>

      <p>The name "gemsbok" comes from Afrikaans and ultimately from the Dutch name for the male chamois, but they are separate species with only superficial similarities.</p>

      <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</p></strong>
      <p>You will find the gemsboks just beyond Panda Canyon.</p>
