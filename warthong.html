      <h3>WARTHOGS</h3>

      <p><i>Phacochoerus</i> is a genus of wild pigs in the family Suidae, commonly known as warthogs. It is the sole genus of the subfamily Phacochoerinae. Warthogs are found in open and semi-open habitats across sub-Saharan Africa, including arid regions.</p>

      <p>The best-known species is the common warthog (<i>Phacochoerus africanus</i>). Although covered in bristly hair, warthogs appear mostly bald from a distance. They have tufts on their cheeks and tails, and their most distinct features are their facial warts and long curved tusks, which are especially prominent in males.</p>

      <p>Warthogs are mostly herbivorous, feeding on grasses, roots, and bulbs, but they also consume small animals on occasion. They use their tusks for defense and digging, and often kneel on their front legs while grazing.</p>

      <p>The Cape warthog, a nominate subspecies of the desert warthog, went extinct around 1865, but the remaining species are still widespread and are classified as of Least Concern by the IUCN.</p>

      <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</p></strong>
      <p>You will find the warthogs at WA11, near the elephant enclosure.</p>
