      <h3>GORILLAS</h3>

      <p>Gorillas are ground-dwelling, predominantly herbivorous apes that inhabit the forests of central Africa. The genus <i>Gorilla</i> is divided into two species: the eastern gorillas and the western gorillas, with multiple subspecies. They are the largest living primates by physical size.</p>

      <p>Gorillas share between 95 to 99% of their DNA with humans, making them our closest relatives after chimpanzees and bonobos. Their intelligence, family structures, and emotional expressions are remarkably human-like.</p>

      <p>They live in tropical or subtropical forests, from sea level to mountainous regions. Mountain gorillas inhabit cloud forests at elevations of 2,200 to 4,300 meters, while lowland gorillas live in swamps and dense forests of central and western Africa.</p>

      <p>Gorillas are generally gentle and shy animals. They live in social groups led by a dominant silverback male and are known for their strong family bonds. Despite their size and strength, gorillas are primarily peaceful and spend most of their time foraging for fruit, shoots, and leaves.</p>

      <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</p></strong>
