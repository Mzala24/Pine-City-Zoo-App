      <h3>LIONS</h3>

      <p>The lion (<i>Panthera leo</i>) is one of the five big cats in the genus <i>Panthera</i> and a member of the family Felidae. The commonly used term "African lion" refers to several subspecies found in Africa. With some males exceeding 250 kg (550 lb), the lion is the second-largest living cat after the tiger.</p>

      <p>Wild lions currently live in sub-Saharan Africa and in Asia, where a small endangered population survives in Indiaâ€™s Gir Forest. Historically, lions were much more widespread, found across Africa, Europe, and the Americas.</p>

      <p>Lions are classified as vulnerable, with their populations declining sharply due to habitat loss and conflict with humans. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered.</p>

      <p>Most lions live in savannahs and grasslands where prey is abundant. They are unique among cats for their social behavior, living in prides composed of related females, offspring, and a few dominant males.</p>

      <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</p></strong>
      <p>You will find the lions at the Northern Frontier.</p>
