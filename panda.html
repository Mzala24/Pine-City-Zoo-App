      <h3>PANDAS</h3>

      <p>The giant panda (<i>Ailuropoda melanoleuca</i>), also known as the panda bear or simply panda, is a bear native to south central China. It is easily recognized by the large, distinctive black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body.</p>

      <p>Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda's diet is over 99% bamboo. In the wild, they may occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents or carrion. In captivity, pandas may be fed honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, bananas, or specially prepared food.</p>

      <p>The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in Sichuan province, but also in neighbouring provinces such as Shaanxi and Gansu. Due to deforestation and farming, the panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived.</p>

      <p>The giant panda is considered a conservation-reliant endangered species, and significant efforts are ongoing to preserve its natural habitat and breeding population.</p>

      <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</p></strong>
      <p>You will find the pandas at Panda Canyon.</p>
